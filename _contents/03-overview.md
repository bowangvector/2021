This course is intended for graduate students in Health Sciences to learn the basic principles of machine learning in biomedical research and to build and strengthen their computational skills of medical research. The course aims to equip students with the fundamental knowledge of machine learning (ML). During the course, the students will acquire basic computational skills and hands-on experience to deploy ML algorithms using python. The students will learn the current practices and applications of ML in medicine, and understand what ML can and cannot do for medicine. The goal of this course to establish an essential foundation for graduate students to take the first steps in computational research in medicine.

Introduction to basic principles and current practices of machine learning in biomedical research. Focus on the fundamental ML algorithms with applications in biomedical data; the application of unsupervised learning in genomic data; the application of supervised learning for medical images.
